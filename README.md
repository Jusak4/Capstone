The Regression Analysis of Individual Financial Performance
#  The Regression Analysis of Individual Financial Performance.

Project overview
Regression analysis is a strong method and commonly used in estimation of parameters. This project will study earning patterns from different businesses set by individual and try to check business that has positive or negative contribution to the total earnings of the owner.
Many individuals set different businesses and at a time business collapses due to lack of mathematical accountability per specific business. This model will help such investors detect businesses that may reduce earnings and do away with them. Supermarket may also benefit with such models since they depend on different sub businesses to make profit.
Data accompanying this study was collected from an investor who has set three businesses, that is shop, chemist and rent from real estate investments. The data is recorded on daily basis.

Excel was the software used for analysis in this project.
